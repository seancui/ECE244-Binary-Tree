The code in this repository are my solutions to the binary tree lab for the class ECE244 at the University of Toronto.

The program allows the user to add, remove, find, etc. website URLs to a binary search tree.

Feel free to use this code as reference (and hopefully it helps), however I will ask that you DO NOT copy the code directly as that is flat out plagiarism. Have fun coding!

Cheers,

Sean
